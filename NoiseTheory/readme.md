## What is Noise?

**"Noise"** refers to a random or pseudo-random signal that lacks any discernible pattern, but **mantains spatial coherence**. This noise is often used as a fundamental building block in generating natural-looking textures, patterns, or landscapes in computer graphics, simulations, and procedural content generation.

Keeping spatial coherence opposite to being a random signal is the most notable feature of a noise function, and rather than a less than accurate description, the best way to understand noise is to compare it with pure randomness values:

In the image above the differences and applications of noise can be spotted. **Noise yields series of random values that have spatial continuity, opposite to pure randomness, where each value is completely independent from the previous one**

This spatial continuity, or coherence, has a lot of applications in computer graphics, it can be used to generate images and textures procedurally, surfaces, maps and clouds, among many examples. 

### Noise Types

There are many types of noise functions, most of them invented by [Ken Perlin](https://cs.nyu.edu/~perlin/). The most notable ones are

- **Perlin noise** is a type of gradient noise that uses value interpolation over a series of random values taking into account gradients over vertices.
- **Value Noise** was also invented by Ken Perlin, it can be seen as a simplification of perlin noise, instead of interpolating values using random gradients, it assigns random values to the vertices and interpolates the points within.  
- **Simplex Noise** was also developed by Ken Perlin as an improvement over Perlin noise, it is a type of gradient noise like Perlin noise. It has a lower computational complexity and is often faster to generate than Perlin noise.
Simplex noise produces similar natural-looking patterns with better properties in higher dimensions and reduced directional artifacts.
- **Worley Noise (Cellular Noise)**, also known as cellular noise, generates patterns based on the proximity of sample points to randomly distributed seed points or "cells.". It produces cell-like structures with regions of varying characteristics, such as Voronoi cells or "regions of influence."
Worley noise is useful for generating irregular patterns, textures, and terrain features.

Lastly, we can also encounter **fractal noise** in the literature, which is not a new noise function by itself, but a combination of the same function with different factors:

- **Fractal Noise**  refers to noise functions generated by combining multiple octaves of a base noise function at different frequencies and amplitudes. Each octave represents a layer of noise, with each subsequent octave having a higher frequency and lower amplitude. Fractal noise, such as fractal Brownian motion (fBm), is commonly used to generate complex, self-similar patterns resembling natural textures and phenomena.


We will focus on **value noise** and **perlin noise** in this document as they provide the basis to understand other noise functions.

### Interpolation insights

In this section we detail how the **interpolation methods and fade function** work and their properties, as they are key factors to yield continuous and smooth noise signals. 

This section is also placed on a [dedicated file](interpolation.md) (WIP)

### Composition and Textures

Noise signals and the ability to compose several of them together, along with other math function signals open a lot of possibilities in form of terrain generation, textures and other things. 

I review the ones proposed by Perlin in a [dedicated file](composition_and_textures.md) (WIP)

## Noise in Processing

Finally, a review on how to use the built in noise function in processing is also provided [here](noise_in_processing.md) (WIP)
